		<h2>Navy Requirements</h2>

		<p>Guess what shipmate, OPNAVINST 5100.23 places <strong>additional requirements</strong> on you as a rider!</p>

		<p>OPNAVINST 5100.23 goes above and beyond the requirements for Washington State with regards to riding. The state requires a valid endorsement (you have passed up to Level 3 training), a helmet, and eye protection. 5100.23 Chapter 36 requires the same <strong>plus</strong> the following:
			<ul>
				<li>Level 4 training such as the Motorcycle Safety Foundation Advanced Rider Course or courses outlined <a href="/level4">here</a>.</li>
				<li>You must take refreshers of Level 2 and Level 4 training every five years.</li>
				<li>Training can be taken at any <strong>state</strong> approved motorcycle safety school or DOD provided training facility.</li>
				<li>Motorcycles must be street legal and must comply with local installation, host-nation, federal, state, and local laws and regulations.</li>
				<li>You are <strong>required</strong> to wear sturdy, over the ankle footwear.</li>
				<li>You are <strong>required</strong> to wear an upper garment with long sleeves which cover the wrist.</li>
				<li>You are <strong>required</strong> to wear a lower garment with pant legs which cover the ankle.</li>
				<li>You are <strong>required</strong> to wear full-fingered gloves constructed of abrasion resistant materials such as leather, Kevlar&reg;, or CORDURA&reg; Nylon.</li>
				<li>When riding a government-owned motorcycle, knee guards, shin guards, and padded full-fingered gloves are required.</li>
				<li>You are <strong>required</strong> to coordinate with a Traffic Safety Coordinator (TSC) or Motorcycle Safety Representative (MSR) for your command. You must provide your name, type of motorcycle, license, and proof of training.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>Failure to comply with the above requirements could mean your next of kin does not receive death benefits should you become a fatality.</p>

		<p>Fortunately, as a member of the DOD, you are provided with the opportunity to attend the Motorcycle Safety Foundation Basic Rider Course, Basic Rider Course 2, and Advanced Rider Course at no cost to you. Go to <a href="http://navymotorcyclerider.com/">Navy Motorcycle Rider</a> and follow the link to Global Training Registration in ESAMS.</p>
